## Introduction

This repository contains C# code examples illustrating the usage of delegates, lambda expressions, and events. It includes several classes (`Student`, `EventsWithDelegates`, `Video1`, `Video3_4`) each showcasing different aspects of these features. All examples and tasks in this project are based on tutorials from the following YouTube playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE7FECFFFCBE1A54].

## Features

- **Delegates**: Demonstrates how to declare, instantiate, and use delegates.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Shows usage of lambda expressions for concise inline functions.
- **Events**: Illustrates how to declare, raise, and handle events in C#.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Delegates-LambdaExpressions-And-Events.git
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

## Usage

Explore each class (`Student`, `EventsWithDelegates`, `Video1`, `Video3_4`) to understand different aspects of delegates, lambda expressions, and events in C#. Run the examples provided in `Program.cs` to see them in action.

## Examples

- **Student Class**: Demonstrates event handling with `Enrolled` event.
- **EventsWithDelegates Class**: Shows how to subscribe and unsubscribe from events dynamically.
- **Video1 Class**: Provides basic examples of delegate usage with `Foo` and `Goo` methods.
- **Video3_4 Class**: Illustrates the use of lambda expressions in pipeline functions.
